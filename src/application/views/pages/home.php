		<h2>What is CLOCK?</h2>
		<p>The University of Lincoln and Cambridge University Library both delivered successful projects (Jerome and COMET) for the JISC Infrastructure for Resource Discovery Programme in 2011. Both projects produced outputs of interest to researchers, students, librarians, developers, and designers of bibliographic discovery environments.</p>
		<p>The CLOCK project is harnessing the success of these two complementary initiatives and investigating new approaches to data creation and discovery in the library domain. In particular, CLOCK will investigate, propose, and develop new, web-based bibliographic tools which will make it easier for different users; cataloguers in academic libraries, and the "serious, tech-savvy" researcher, to find Open Bibliographic Data and incorporate that data into systems and workflows.</p>
		<p>The CLOCK project's overall aim is to challenge assumptions and drive innovation in libraries' interaction with bibliographic data. The project team believe that an important aspect of this innovation will be serious consideration given to the development of an awesome, national, open scholarly catalogue knowledgebase for the UK ("data.ac.uk/library" or "library.data.ac.uk").</p>
